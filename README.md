## What We Did

The front end site and seed data was provided. We refactored the front end for user experience, amended the units and added minor validation around adding null data.

We built the backend from the MongoDB models, api & html routes to the server connection allowing us to deploy to Heroku, utilising MongoDB Atlas to host our data.
