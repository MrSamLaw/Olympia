## Description

Olympia is a fitness tracker using MongoDB to store data. It allows anonymous users to enter exercises into workouts and track the total duration and weight lifted of their last 7 workouts.

## What We Did

The front end site and seed data was provided. Some minor amendments were made to the front end for user experience and validation.

We built the backend from the MongoDB models, api & html routes to the server connection allowing us to deploy to Heroku, utilising MongoDB Atlas to host our data.
